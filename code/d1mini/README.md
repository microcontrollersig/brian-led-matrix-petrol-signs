# Uploading software to D1 mini


# Usage

### Connecting to D1 mini webpage

There are two modes of operation to connect:

* **Captive portal mode** 
  
  When you first use the D1 mini for the first time with the uploaded software provided, you will enter captive portal mode.
  
  Connect to a Wifi SSID created by the D1 mini
  
  Go to http://192.168.4.1 (depending on yout default browser, this may open automatically)


  Enter the username/password of your local wifi network, then click **Save and Connect**

  You now reconnect to your normal wifi network, and you will then need to find the IP address of the device on your network.
  Angry IP scanner is a good tool to use for this task. 
  
* **Normal mode** 
  
  If you have done the captival portal mode and saved your wifi password, subsequent reboots of the D1 mini will
  attempt to your wifi network. If it can't connect, you will fall back to captive portal mode.
  
  Else, if d1 mini establishes a wifi connection, you can then control the LED matrix with a webpage like the one below.
