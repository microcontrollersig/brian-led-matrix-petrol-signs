# LittleFS

A file system for the ESP8266.

In order to use it, you can't install esp8266 arduino core from Board Manager.

Instead you have to use the instructions [here](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html#using-git-version)

You then need to install the LittleFS arduino IDE plugin [here](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin)

Not sure if upload sketch-> then upload little files or vice versa, but it works.
